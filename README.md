This modpack was originally created by Nebula Network in 2015 aims to replicate the setup used by Aphmau in her popular 2015 Minecraft series, Minecraft Diaries. The modpack is designed to provide fans of the series with a similar experience by including a variety of mods that were used by Aphmau during the early days of the series.
The modpack is a fan-made creation and is not affiliated with Aphmau in any way. Nebula Network has no official association with Aphmau or her production team. The modpack is purely a labor of love and an attempt to recreate the early production of the Minecraft Diaries series for fans.

- This version of MC Diaries aims to replicate the original 1.7.10 modpack and bring it onto newer versions of MC. Please view the version history heading for more information
